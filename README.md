# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio, deployed to https://rmcwhae.netlify.app/ (awaiting actual launch). Feel free to have a look under the hood. Built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: photos are not under source control as they would take too much space.

## Deployment

`npm run build` then take the output of `build` and serve it.
