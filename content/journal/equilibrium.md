As soon as I could walk I was on skis. Somewhere on a VHS cassette—remember those?—there is footage of me as a toddler shuffling around my childhood home on mini skis. Despite growing up in Canada’s frigid prairies, hockey was not in the cards. Too _mainstream_, according to my parents. My two brothers and I were destined to spend our childhood winters cross-country skiing.

Through our local nordic ski club, we learned to ski: classic first, then skate a few years later. I still remember my first ski race at age eight or nine, a short lap around the Canmore Nordic Centre: I cried almost the entire time and finished last. I guess the nerves were too much for me to handle then. (And perhaps still are. I never quite understood the purpose of seeing who can make it around the hamster-wheel the quickest.)

Still, I stuck with nordic-ski racing for many years. In solo races, I rarely finished faster than the middle of the pack, though podium finishes were occasionally realized in relays when buoyed up by faster teammates.

In grade five, I experienced my first-ever downhill ski day at Nakiska ski resort. My brother and I were able to skip a few levels of basic lessons thanks to our nordic-skiing backgrounds. At the time, clever marketers offered a promotion to students in grade five: three free ski days at most ski resorts in western Canada. It occurs to me now that drug-dealers employ similar tactics: get 'em hooked for free, then jack up the prices. If you think about it, the outcome is similar in both scenarios: you may well find yourself up to your eyeballs in white powder! (I couldn’t _not_ make this joke.) My first ever pair of alpine skis were actually telemark skis, with leather boots and three-pin bindings, purchased after the success of the downhill-ski experiment. At the end of that first day of taking chairlifts to go uphill, I asked, “What, exactly, _is_ the exercise value in downhill skiing?”

Come junior high school, my interests took to video games, and my middling racing career took a backseat to electronic entertainment. (At least insofar as was permitted by my parents: maximum one hour of computer time per day, usually stretched in the presence of unsuspecting babysitters). One fall with a particular lack of motivation on my part about the upcoming ski season, new skis to match my rapidly growing adolescent body were not invested in.

Junior high was a relatively sedentary period of my life. I still telemarked occasionally to maintain some semblance of an active lifestyle, despite my earlier skepticism of its exercise value.

My intermittent telemark/downhill skiing continued in high school. I caught the gym bug and managed to bulk up to 186 pounds (my current lean-and-mean build is around 165). I hate to think what the grocery bill for a gym-rat teenager would now be.

In undergrad, I skied only a handful of times each winter, usually in early May after having finished the winter semester and moving back to Calgary for the summer. I dabbled in indoor climbing during university as well.

Upon starting my first full-time engineering job post graduation, I rediscovered the notion of free time. (I cannot recommend studying engineering if you value your evenings and weekends.) With disposable income and time, I became inspired to explore the mountains and binged mountain literature, movies, and culture. At one point, I got a signed poster at the Banff Mountain Film Festival from Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, the first woman to climb all 14 8,000 metre peaks without supplemental oxygen.

In June 2013, I signed up for a week-long [Intro to Mountaineering](/events/Intro-to-Mountaineering_June-2013) course out of Bow Hut, where we learned the basics of glacier travel, crevasse rescue, self-arresting with a ice axe, and compass-based navigation. A few of the other participants were Calgary locals, so we exchanged numbers and kicked off our mountaineering careers together.

We climbed together that summer, teaching ourselves the basics of sport and trad climbing, attempting a few different mountaineering objectives (including a doomed attempt of the Runde Traverse, more on that in [30 Going on 13](/journal/30-going-on-13#introduction)). When winter came, our ambitions changed to ice climbing and backcountry skiing.

Having long since mastered downhill and nordic skiing, backcountry skiing was the logical next step in my winter outdoor pursuits. Over the course of next number of seasons, I took courses, went on guided trips, and built up my gear, fitness, and experience. Young, fit, and keen, I set off to find adventure in the mountains. Starting with day trips in benign terrain, I gradually worked my way up to ski-mountaineering and multi-day, tent-based ski traverses, where covering a lot of horizontal ground efficiently, as in nordic skiing, is paramount. I dreamed to ski bigger and better objectives, and to see just how far I could take it.

The mountains were calling, and so I went.

On a guided trip to [Mistaya Lodge](/events/Mistaya_March-2014), we toured up to a col that overlooked the northern part of the Wapta Icefield. Mistaya, way up the Blaeberry valley and accessed by helicopter from Golden, is actually fairly close to Bow Hut, where I’d just done my mountaineering course. I took a photo of the vista, where a guide said you could see Peyto Hut. Not knowing exactly where to look—a metal-hut needle in an expansive snow-covered alpine haystack—I gave up searching and stashed my camera.

At the end of the ski week, the guides presented us with two options for the final day: to ski up and over the same col, then traverse across a glacier to exit via Peyto Lake to a waiting shuttle, or to ski a final day near the lodge then fly out back to Golden. I opted for the second choice but was nonetheless intrigued by the idea of traversing glaciers on skis in winter—still beyond my skill set but perhaps something that could one day come into range.

A few years later, some friends and I undertook a self-guided traverse of the Wapta icefield and stayed at Peyto hut on the first night. After that trip, I revisited my Mistaya photos and—now knowing exactly where to look—found Peyto hut in my photo, a small dark dot, easily mistaken for a rock outcropping.

In terrible weather, three others and I set out on the Spearhead traverse.

**12:00 PM, February 23, 2019**  
In six years and over 150 days of backcountry skiing, I triggered my first minor avalanche.

Two friends and I were ascending the broad, south-facing summit ridge of Cirque Peak. Our intention was to ski [Cirque North Couloir](/events/Cirque-Peak-North-Couloir_February-2019) (note the chunks of avalanche debris behind the skier in the first photo), a classic Rockies ski-descent that is frequently attempted in ski-guide exams.

Above tree line, the main ascent route gradually starts up the summit ridge. Low on this ridge, we encountered a restriction in our route: the ridge got narrower and steeper with a short gully ascending between two rock bands on either side. Too steep to skin, it would require a boot-pack. The alternative route of traversing out onto the looker’s-right face—a large, exposed alpine slope—was far less appealing.

I stowed my skis on my pack and began post-holing into waist-deep snow, punching through the wind-hammered crust endemic to so much of Rockies alpine terrain.

My hazard assessment had been that if the snow in the gully slid, it would likely have a small volume, and I’d go for a short ride down the centre of the broad ridge—hardly a terrain trap. The ridge had a low-enough angle (we’d been switchbacking up it on skins until that point) that I was not concerned about rocketing down it if the snow failed. (Or worse—tomahawking.)

Nearing the middle of my boot-pack, the wind pocket inside the gully released (maybe a size 0.5). All around me, the formerly stiff snow unzippered into large chunks, like a taught guitar string snapping.

Flipped over backwards, I was now sliding on my back, backpack and skis below me, head-first down the gully, like an inverted beetle. I distinctly remember trying to sense my velocity and if it was exponentially increasing. Thankfully, I came to a stop, unburied, where the slope-angle relaxed a few meters down.

Unharmed, I righted myself and regrouped with my partners. My boots had filled with snow between the plastic shell and inner liners, which I cleared while waiting for my heart rate to settle. At my high point in the gulley, the avalanche crown was perhaps two feet deep at worst, tapering as it extended horizontally a few meters in each direction. Wind effect in the gully had created at least one buried weak layer in the snowpack, which the outer wind slab had slid on once my boot-packing had compromised its structural integrity.

With the majority of snow flushed out of the no-longer-suspect gully, we opted to continue attempting our objective. There is a bolted rappel near the summit which we used to rappel on two 40 m half-ropes. The rappel isn’t strictly necessary as the North Couloir is relatively low angle, though it makes descending the upper rocky section more palatable.

We finished the day without further incident. In over 250 ski days now, this is the only avalanche involvement I have ever directly experienced—fortunately a harmless one.

I never thought it would happen to me, but alas it has: since moving to a ski town, I have skied less than before. At the time of this writing, I have had only 24 days of touring this season. I was too cheap to pay for an annual resort pass—despite the high-volume of white powder delivered—and only skied a single local’s day (Revy local’s ski for $20, with proceeds going to the food bank; _this_ promotion I can get behind). To non-skiers, 24 probably sounds like an impressive number; however, some of my best seasons had over 50.

Don’t get me wrong—I still had a great ski season. I finally skied the Tupper traverse at Rogers, which was every bit as good as I imagined it would be. There were many delightful turns to be had in local touring areas such as Begbie shoulder and the MacPherson fingers as lower elevation snow coverage this winter greatly exceeded that of the previous. Last year, we had to shovel our driveway maybe five times; this year, dozens, with relentless heavy, wet snow. Now I understand why people own snowblowers here: they aren’t lazy but rather interested in not ruining their bodies with exertion. I also don’t think I’ve sustained a cheesy grin as long as in re-learning to skate ski this winter (my Christmas present to myself was a set of skate ski gear).

But why the drop in ski ambition?

Let’s briefly return to my pre-touring days of pumping iron and eating chicken breasts. In high school chemistry we studied the concept of equilibrium. When chemical reactants are mixed, they react to form different products. As chemical reactions are reversible, this is not a one-way process. In a given reaction, there will thus be a rate of forward reaction (reactants generating products) and a rate of reverse reaction (products generating reactants). When these rates are equal, the system is said to be in dynamic equilibrium, where the concentrations of reactants and products appear not to change in time.

As an introduction to this concept, we performed an experiment using graduated cylinders, drinking straws, and water. One cylinder started with 50 ml of water (A), and the other was empty (B; both had identical volumes). Then, placing a drinking straw in each cylinder down to the bottom, we sealed the tops of each straw with our fingers to capture the water (air in the case of cylinder B), then emptied each straw into the opposite cylinder that it came from. After one round, about 5 ml of water transferred from cylinder A to B, with none in the other direction. In round two, an amount less than 5 ml came out of cylinder A’s 45 ml, and a minute amount came from the 5 ml now in cylinder B. After enough rounds, the transfer between A and B equalizes, and continued transfer of water between both cylinders does not affect the volume in either. The liquid transfer serves as an anology for chemical reaction rate: highly variable in the beginning, with greather forward bias, that eventually reaches dynamic equilibrium in time.

This concept of dyamic equilibrium can in turn apply to outdoor pursuits. In my early days of ski touring, there was a strong forward bias in my ski aspirations. This was an exciting time, from first learning what was possible, like skiing _up_ mountains and multi-day glacier traverses, to then undertaking and successfully completing some such objectives. Like the early stages of a chemical reaction, things were changing rapidly: my experience grew, my network of ski partners blossomed, and I explored many wild places far beyond the reach of the non-outdoor-inclined. I even like skiing so much that I changed careers to work in the ski industry (not in the front line, like guiding, though).

And yet, with hundreds of ski days across many years, now living in one of Canada’s best ski towns, I haven’t been able to sustain the volume of skiing of years past. I can still go and bang out 2000-meter days and have great fun in so doing, but the thrill somehow isn’t quite the same as in earlier years. Is this just a temporary ebb in the flow of pursuing a passion—perhaps spurred by changing careers and cities during a global pandemic—or could it be something more?

Is it possible that my ski ambition has reached a state of equilibrium with the other aspirations of my life?

For perhaps the first time in my life, I have found professional work that I enjoy, am good at, and is lucrative. It’s a trifecta that eluded me for many years. In my twenties, skiing was always the _escape_ from my working reality, and now, in a way, it has become my reality.

It has been said that a typical backcountry skier is a 27-year-old male (forgot where I read that). I’d go even further to say that they are also likely an engineer. In my twenties, I was largely unconcerned by what I considered at the time to be uninteresting adult pursuits: careers, mortgages, and starting families. In a long-since-forgotten ski movie, a woman commented that “In a world where a lot of things are soul crushing, skiing is something that has a lot of soul.” I lived by these words for the better part of a decade.

But can there be more to life than outdoor pursuits? And need other life ambitions be mutually exclusive with outdoor passions? I recently read the 1951 climbing novel _One Green Bottle_ by Elizabeth Coxhead. (If you are anyone who has spent time outside, this novel is a must read.) In it, protagonist Cathy Canning, a girl from the Liverpool slums, discovers climbing and its associated world of adventure, peril, and romance, while navigating the class segregation of 1950s Britain. Another character, Johhny Hollinger, the trash-talking second son of an earl, who makes no pretence of his own dubious morality, is one of the stronger climbers Cathy meets.

Cathy and Johnny rope up and climb a multi-pitch route together. (This was before the time of removable protection such as nuts and cams—the term piton does not appear once in the book—so climbing in 1950s England was apparently rope-soloing. To think that climbers today are nervous to lead on _bolted_ routes.) After successfully finishing a hard climb together, they relax in the sun, and debate the pull between climbing and other priorities in life:

> “If it could be like this always!” she murmured, half asleep.
>
> “Well,” Johnny murmured back, “why not?”
>
> She smiled into the heat-haze banked over the Portmadoc sands. “Well—there’s other things in life, I suppose, besides climbing.”
>
> “There needn’t be. Of course, if you must tie yourself up and add more brats to the quantities already crawling about that’s your look-out.”
>
> “But Johnny!” She sat up, now quite awake. “Is coming up here all you care about? Aren’t you interested in your job, or—or falling in love, or anything?”
>
> “Job, no. Love, yes, by all means, as long as there aren’t any boring consequences.” He opened his lazy eyes at last and gave her his impudent monkey look; … She said coldly, with Puritan disapproval:
>
> “That's cheating.”
>
> “Oh well, yes, if you like,” agreed Johnny, preparing to go to sleep again.
>
> … Who was she to read Johnny a lecture? Yet it seemed such a pity, somehow. She saw him forty years hence, a little shrivelled nut, a mountain bachelor, with nothing to show for all the skill and courage, all the grace and beauty that had been his. She said slowly:
>
> “I wonder would you think the same if you’d been born the eldest son? The one that’s got to be the next earl?”
>
> Johnny looked amused. “Oh, quite possibly. I can’t imagine anything making a worthy character out of me. But I must admit that brother Ludovic runs around simply dripping public spirit and noblesse oblige.”
>
> “Well,” said Cathy with sudden magnificence, “in my family I’m the eldest.”
>
> Johnny found this funnier still. “Have it your own way, sweetheart,” he said with utmost amiability. “But I’ve noticed that for a lot of people, and particularly women, that means trying to have it both ways. In which case, don’t say I didn’t warn you. I’ve thought the matter out, and I know that the life of pleasure is a full-time job.”

Johnny goes on to warn Cathy when she is faced with a potential suitor to “Have your bit of fun with him, … and marry him in the end if you must. Only get your serious climbing done first, and try to remember what I told you—you can’t have it both ways.”

Now that I am in my thirties

I’ve now met a few ski guides who have largely abandoned recreational ski touring. One remarked that he had “skied more than enough powder for the rest of [his] life.”

Ski ambition can change in an instant: a life-changing injury, or a loved one lost to an accident.

Throw in the right reactants, and your product might just be a white powder.

## Ideas

-   Leave rat in a jar for a month. Ambition to ski balances with other pressures of life.
-   But what other pressures really? One Green Bottle shrivelled mountain bachelor and not having it both ways quotations.
-   An imbalance of priorities.
-   Conclusion no more original than “everything in moderation”? Is there more to life than the outdoors? But what does that look like?
-   Quotation about a weekend simply dull Summit Fever
-   Typical backcountry skier: male, 27

Essay time. This one is for anyone who has spent years chasing a dream but isn’t sure where exactly it will take them. Enjoy!
