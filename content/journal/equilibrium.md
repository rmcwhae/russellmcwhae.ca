As soon as I could walk I was on skis. Somewhere on a VHS cassette—remember those?—there is footage of me as a toddler shuffling around my childhood home on mini skis. Despite growing up in Canada’s frigid prairies, hockey was not in the cards. Too _mainstream_, according to my parents. My two brothers and I were destined to spend our childhood winters cross-country skiing.

Through our local nordic ski club, we learned to ski: classic first, then skate a few years later. I still remember my first ski race at age eight or nine, a short lap around the Canmore Nordic Centre: I cried almost the entire time and finished last. I guess the nerves were too much for me to handle then. (And perhaps still are. I never quite understand the purpose of seeing who can make it around the hamster-wheel the quickest.)

Still, I stuck with nordic-ski racing for many years. In solo races, I rarely finished faster than the middle of the pack, though podium finishes were occasionally realized in relays when buoyed up by faster teammates.

In Grade 5, after my very first downhill ski day at Nakiska—where my brother and I were able to skip a few levels of lessons thanks to our nordic-skiing backgrounds—I concluded by asking, “What, exactly, is the exercise value in downhill skiing?” My first downhill skis were actually telemark skis, with leather boots and three-pin bindings.

Come junior-high school, my interests took to video games, and my middling racing career took a backseat to electronic entertainment. (At least as far as was permitted by my parents: maximum one hour of computer time per day, stretched in the presence of unsuspecting babysitters). One fall with a particular lack of motivation on my part about the upcoming ski season, new skis to match my rapidly growing adolescent body were not invested in.

Junior high was a relatively sedentary period of my life. I still telemarked occasionally to maintain some semblance of an active lifestyle, despite my earlier skepticism of its exercise value.

My intermittent telemark/downhill skiing continued in high school. I caught the gym bug and managed to bulk up to 186 pounds (my current lean-and-mean build is around 165). I hate to think what the grocery bill for a gym-rat teenager would now be.

In undergrad, I skied only a handful of times each winter, usually in early May after having finished the winter semester and moving back to Calgary for the summer. I dabbled in indoor climbing during university as well.

Upon starting my first full-time engineering job post graduation, I rediscovered the notion of free time (I cannot recommend studying engineering if you value your evenings and weekends), and with it, became inspired to explore the mountains. I even got a signed poster at the Banff Mountain Film Festival from Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, the first woman to climb all 14 8,000 metre peaks without supplemental oxygen.

I signed up for a week-long Introduction to Mountaineering course out of Bow Hut, where we learned the basics of glacier travel, crevasse rescue, self-arresting with a ice axe, and compass-based navigation. A few of the other participants were Calgary locals, so we exchanged numbers and kicked off our mountaineering careers together.

We climbed together that summer, teaching ourselves the basics of sport and trad climbing, attempting a few different mountaineering objectives (including a doomed attempt of the Runde Traverse, more on that in [30 Going on 13](/journal/30-going-on-13#introduction)). When winter came, our aspirations changed to ice climbing and backcountry skiing.

Having long since mastered downhill and nordic skiing, backcountry skiing was the logical next step in winter outdoor pursuits. Over the course of next number of seasons, I took courses, went on guided trips, and built up my gear, fitness, and experience.

Young, fit, and ambitious, I set off to find adventure in the mountains. Starting with day trips in benign terrain, I gradually worked my way up to ski-mountaineering, and multi-day tent-based ski traverses, where covering a lot of horizontal ground efficiently, as in nordic skiing, is paramount.

The mountains were calling, and so I went.

On a guided trip to Mistaya Lodge, we toured up to a col that overlooked the northern part of the Wapta Icefield. I took a photo of the vista, snow-covered alpine terrain, where the guide said you could see Peyto Hut. Not knowing where to look, it eluded me until a few years later when I stayed at Peyto hut on a self-guided traverse of the Wapta. Once I looked at my photo again, there Peyto hut was, once hidden, now no longer the rock outcropping I’d mistaken it for. (A few years after that, I skied the Wapta in a single day.)

In six years and over 150 days of backcountry skiing, I triggered my first avalanche.

Two friends and I were ascending the broad, south-facing summit ridge of Cirque Peak. Our intention was to ski Cirque North Couloir, a classic Rockies ski-descent that is frequently attempted in ski-guide exams.

Above tree line, the main ascent route gradually starts up the summit ridge. Low on this ridge, we encountered a restriction in our route: the ridge got narrower and steeper with a short gully ascending between two rock bands on either side. Too steep to skin, it would require a boot-pack. The alternative route of traversing out onto the looker’s-right face—a large, exposed alpine slope—was far less appealing.

I stowed my skis on my pack and began post-holing into waist-deep snow, punching through the wind-hammered crust endemic to so much of Rockies alpine terrain.

My hazard assessment had been that if the snow in the gully slid, it would likely have a small volume, and I’d go for a short ride down the centre of the broad ridge—hardly a terrain trap. The ridge had a low-enough angle (we’d been switchbacking up it on skins until that point) that I was not concerned about rocketing down it if the snow failed. (Or worse—tomahawking.)

Nearing the middle of my boot-pack, the wind pocket inside the gully released. All around me, the formerly stiff snow instantly shattered into large chunks in what felt like a single plink, as if a taught rope had suddenly been released.

Flipped over backwards, I was now sliding on my back, backpack and skis below me, head-first down the gully, like an inverted beetle. I distinctly remember trying to sense my velocity and if it was multiplying. Fortunately, I came to a stop, unburied, where the slope-angle relaxed a few meters down.

Unharmed, I righted myself and regrouped with my partners. My boots had filled with snow between the plastic shell and inner liners, which I cleared while waiting for my heart rate to settle. At my high point in the gulley, the avalanche crown was perhaps two feet deep at worst, tapering as it extended horizontally a few meters in each direction. Wind effect in the gully had created at least one buried weak layer in the snowpack, which the outer wind slab had slid on once my boot-packing had compromised its structural integrity.

With the majority of snow flushed out of the no-longer-suspect gully, we opted to continue attempting our objective, which we completed without further incident. There is a bolted rappel near the summit which we used to rappel on two 40 m half-ropes. The rappel isn’t strictly necessary as the North Couloir is relatively low-angle, though it makes descending the upper rocky section more palatable.

In high school chemistry we studied equilibrium. When chemical reactants are mixed, they react to form different products. As chemical reactions are reversible, this is not a one-way process. In a given reaction, there will thus be a rate of forward reaction (reactants generating products) and a rate of reverse reaction (products generating reactants). When these rates are equal, the system is said to be in dynamic equilibrium, where the concentrations of reactants and products appear not to change in time.

As an introduction to this concept, we performed an experiment using graduated cylinders, drinking straws, and water. One cylinder started with 50 ml of water (A), and the other was empty (B; both had identical volumes). Then, placing a drinking straw in each cylinder down to the bottom, we sealed the tops of each straw with our fingers to capture the water (air in the case of cylinder B), then emptied each straw into the opposite cylinder that it came from. After one round, about 5 ml of water transferred from cylinder A to B, with none in the other direction. In round two, an amount less than 5 ml came out of cylinder A, and a minute amount came from cylinder B. After enough rounds, the transfer between A and B equalized, the straw-liquid transfer serving an anology for the dynamic reaction rate: highly variable in the beginning, with greather forward bias, then eventually reaching dynamic equilibrium.

The concept of dyamic equilibrium can in turn apply to outdoor pursuits. In my early days of skiing, there was a strong forward bias in my ski aspirations. This is an exciting time …

## Ideas

-   Ski anecdotes. Avalanche, Bailing BBB. Spearhead.
-   High school equilibrium analogy. Leave rat in a jar for a month. Ambition to ski balances with other pressures of life.
-   But what other pressures really? One Green Bottle shrivelled mountain bachelor and not having it both ways quotations.
-   Long-since forgotten ski movie, one skier says “in a world where a lot of things are soul crushing, skiing is something that has a lot of soul”.
-   An imbalance of priorities.
-   Conclusion no more original than “everything in moderation”? Is there more to life than the outdoors? But what does that look like? For the first time, I have a job I enjoy and and good at. Moved to a ski town and ski less than before (but still lots).
-   Quotation about a weekend simply dull Summit Fever
