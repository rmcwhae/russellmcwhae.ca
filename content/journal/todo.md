## Launch blurb

Five years and over 550 code commits later (all in the last four months), I finally got around to relaunching my personal website: https://russellmcwhae.ca. The code quality has improved tremendously—and so has the performance: the new version is faaaaast (see how quickly stuff loads when clicking around). While it features a fully responsive design that will work on smaller devices, the best experience is on something larger like a tablet or computer. Photos are oh-so-gorgeous on such larger screens. For the geeks, here is a more in-depth writeup on the redevelopment: https://russellmcwhae.ca/journal/new-website. And if this wasn’t enough, I’ve also snuck in a preview of my upcoming 2022 calendar—orders will be happening soon!
