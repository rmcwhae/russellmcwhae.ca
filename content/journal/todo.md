## Launch blurb

It only took five years, but I finally got around to rebuilding my personal website: https://russellmcwhae.ca. Naturally, the code quality has improved tremendously—and so has the performance, especially with images. While it features a fully responsive design that will work on smaller devices, the best experience is on something larger like a tablet or computer (put down your phones people!). Photos (https://russellmcwhae.ca/photography) are oh-so-gorgeous on such larger screens. I found it quite fun to look back on various adventures over the years: https://russellmcwhae.ca/events. For the geeks, here is a more in-depth writeup on the redesign/redevelopment: https://russellmcwhae.ca/journal/new-website. Happy surfing!
