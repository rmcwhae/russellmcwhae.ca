## Launch checklist

-   Update repo readme
-   Update photo gallery with `npm i -D "github:dimsemenov/photoswipe#v5-beta"`
-   Update svelte with `npm i -D @sveltejs/kit@next` and `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static@next`

## Launch blurb

It only took five years and over 500 (!) git commits, but I finally got around to rebuilding my personal website: https://russellmcwhae.ca. Naturally, the code quality has improved tremendously—and so has the performance: the new version is faaaaast (see how quickly stuff loads when clicking around). While it features a fully responsive design that will work on smaller devices, the best experience is on something larger like a tablet or computer. Photos (https://russellmcwhae.ca/photography) are oh-so-gorgeous on such larger screens. For the geeks, here is a more in-depth writeup on the redesign: https://russellmcwhae.ca/journal/new-website. Go check it out!
