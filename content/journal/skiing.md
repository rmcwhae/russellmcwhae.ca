Sometimes my friends shoot our ski days with GoPros. Here are some videos that they took. I do make appearances in each of this videos.

* January 27, 2014: [Mount Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVn1yhuvz4g)
* April 19, 2014: [Cathedral Mountain](https://youtu.be/9PmYwvRyLVw). Skip to [15:10](https://youtu.be/9PmYwvRyLVw?t=15m10s) to see the spicy descent down a 6-foot vertical ice step that formed on the north-facing keyhole route that year—just don’t ask how we got up it. This is one of my top-three mountain days of all time.
* December 10, 2016: [Mount Jimmy Simpson Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRc1m6UYrQM) | [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbQJ2eqkd58)
* February 11, 2017: [Grizzly Shoulder, Rogers Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kpBHzbgQJg). Probably the best pow I have ever skied. Grizzly Shoulder is among the lowest-hanging fruit of backcountry ski terrain at Rogers Pass and as such it attracts its share of traffic and is tracked out for most of the winter. In this video, Grizzly Shoulder had been closed for three days due to a storm, and we were the second party to ski it upon re-opening.
