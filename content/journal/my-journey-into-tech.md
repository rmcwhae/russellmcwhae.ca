Around the time I turned 30, software development had entered onto my radar as a career path. I had been studying and working in engineering and science for around twelve years (undergrad, grad school, and industry work) and was ready for a change. In a section exploring my rather non-linear career path in [30 Going on 13](/journal/30-going-on-13#how-to-find-out-what-to-do-with-your-life), I concluded that I was “going to try to working in software development next.”

Now I have been working as a developer for over two years—and realized my dream of moving to a mountain town—so here is a reflection on my experience working in tech.

One of the underlying motivations for this career change was to be live in a mountain town

## Ideas

-   Career change, previous reflection about wanting to try tech.
-   Anna Wiener Uncanny Valley. Writing quotation Paul Theroux: the goal is above all to make you see. HBO Silicon Valley…but TV inferior.
-   Different job markets than engg. More frequent job switching. Tech touches every industry.
-   Web dev: creating vs data science: analysis
