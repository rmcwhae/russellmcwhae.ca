Around the time I turned 30, software development had entered onto my radar as a career path. I had been studying and working in engineering and science for around twelve years (undergrad, grad school, and industry work) and was ready for a change. Now that I have been working as a developer for over two years—and realized my dream of moving to a mountain town—here is a reflection on my experience in tech. (For more details on my non-linear career path and how I ultimately decided on working in tech, see [How to Find Out What to Do With Your Life
](/journal/30-going-on-13#how-to-find-out-what-to-do-with-your-life).)

First, tech is ubiquitous. It has touched almost every industry.

## Ideas

-   Career change, previous reflection about wanting to try tech.
-   Anna Wiener Uncanny Valley. Writing quotation Paul Theroux: the goal is above all to make you see. HBO Silicon Valley…but TV inferior.
-   Different job markets than engg. More frequent job switching. Tech touches every industry.
-   Web dev: creating vs data science: analysis
