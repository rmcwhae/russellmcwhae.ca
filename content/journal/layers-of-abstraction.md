## Ideas

Despite forming some of the most complicated systems in all of engineering and science, software is, fundamentally, electrons moving inside semiconductors. Electrons move through transistors, little logic gates, in microprocessors, also known as central processing units (CPUs). Online banking, video streaming, and every other digital app operates on this principle.

In my day job, primarily writing code in JavaScript, I don’t think about electrons. Code that I write, through a series of automatic conversions and compilations, make its way into machine code, the fundamental language of computers. Once in this binary form, machine code can be input into the central processing unit and processed—turned into an output after running through a processor’s transistors.
