My desktop PC turns 10 this year. It features a quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K processor, released in the second quarter of 2012. As far as gaming PCs go, this is effectively antediluvian. In [April 2020](/journal/adventures-in-low-end-pc-gaming), I put in some modest upgrades—a bigger, faster hard drive and a more powerful video card—for exactly $100 out of pocket.

This past Christmas, I added a WiFi card for around $40. This WiFi card also enabled Bluetooth, a first for my old machine. To test out this new connectivity, I bought a wireless Xbox controller—red, because that was the only colour on sale ($60). While I’ve never been much of a console gamer, certain games do play better with a controller (as opposed to a keyboard and mouse), such as the _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater_ (THPS) series. With my new controller, I played the recently released remake _THPS 1 + 2_, beating all the levels in a delightful nostalgia trip to my pre-teen days of playing the original _THPS 2_ (released in 2000) with a joystick on our family IBM desktop computer (remember CRT monitors?).

(Despite my [latest warning](/journal/the-pendulum-swings) about “the tractor-beam pull of electronic distraction,” I will occasionaly play video games, preferably those of a finite length. After beating _THPS 1 + 2_ this January, I haven’t really touched it since.)

The point of this anecdote is that it can be quite fun to tinker with old hardware. It’s one thing to throw top dollar at the latest and greatest computer components to be on the bleeding edge of performance, but, as we’ll see in this piece, older items—be they PCs, or otherwise—can be just as much fun as more modern stuff, at a fraction of the cost.

I use and maintain a number of toys, including computers (usually a combination of an older desktop PC and a relatively more modern MacBook Pro), cameras and lenses, climbing gear, ski gear (a touring setup and, most recently, some nordic skate skis—another delightful nostalgia trip to my adolescent cross-country-racing days), bikes (usually a combination of a mountain bike and a cheap townie/commuter), and my car. If the marketing rhetoric from gear manufacturers in each of these industries is to be believed, gear is constantly improving, and us, as consumers, will get better performance—and thus more utility—by upgrading and acquiring. But even if you have the means, staying on top of upgrades can be quite overwhelming. EXAMPLE?

Let’s look at how this notion of being behind the upgrade curve applies to some of the toys I have mentioned.

Continuing with computers, old hardware need not be junked as it ages beyond five or more years. Minor upgrades such as the aforementioned WiFi/Bluetooth adapter can extend the functionality or performance of old hardware in interesting new ways. I recently happened upon some old 1 TB 3.5-inch desktop hard drives. I replaced my ailing RAID 1 array (two 1 TB drives mirrored for redundancy, where one of the drives had been giving SMART errors for years and could fail at any minute) with a four-drive RAID 5 array (3 TB of usable space, with one drive for redundancy). For the non-geeks, just understand that my storage capacity tripled for zero dollars.

The recently released Windows 11 will not run on my ancient PC. This leaves me two options: keep running Windows 10, or switch to a Linux distribution. Almost all Linux distros have very modest hardware requirements. If you’re looking for a new purpose for an ancient Windows laptop or desktop, try installing Linux on it and see how the operating system flies.

In a slightly less geeky example of tech, I bought an older used iPad about a year ago (iPad Air 2, launched in 2014). It is now too slow to run any intensive apps or games, but it isn’t too slow for reading ebooks. (It also doubles as a website-testing device as there is no equivalent for actually seeing a website you are developing on physical, not simulated, hardware.)

Among other industries, photography is one where Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) rears its head.

## Ideas

-   Not more and owning the latest and greatest, but less.
-   Less house insurance, less worry/anxiety
-   Marie Kondo: get rid of items that don’t spark joy (listened to on my move to Revy, fitting)
-   Roadkill ripping on Lamborghini vs home built hot rod
-   A Canticle For Leibowitz materially great but lacked spiritual values
-   Find new ways to enjoy old technology: old PC, IR camera, Ubuntu, old iPad, old projector.
-   Things that we love can enslave us. Stuff cutting edge a few years ago. Thrill of new gadgets is fleeting. Get the same thrill without sticker shock or buyer’s remorse.
-   Unused mtn bike collecting dust, or the well loved old bike.
-   Old mtn bike dropper post $125
-   You can export videos in half the time as before—really worth the high price tag
-   Not too far behind: old cars (too old and expensive unless you are handy), sweet spot of age and mileage
-   Calvin and Hobbes: chewing magazine
