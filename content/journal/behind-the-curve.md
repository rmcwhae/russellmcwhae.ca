My desktop PC turns 10 this year. It features a quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K processor, released in the second quarter of 2012. As far as gaming PCs go, this is effectively antediluvian. In [April 2020](/journal/adventures-in-low-end-pc-gaming), I put in some modest upgrades—a bigger, faster hard drive and a more powerful video card—for exactly $100 out of pocket.

This past Christmas, I added a WiFi card for around $40. This WiFi card also enabled Bluetooth, a first for my old machine. To test out this new connectivity, I bought a wireless Xbox controller—red, because that was the only colour on sale ($60). While I’ve never been much of a console gamer, certain games do play better with a controller (as opposed to a keyboard and mouse), such as the _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater_ (THPS) series. With my new controller, I played the recently released remake _THPS 1 + 2_ in a delightful nostalgia trip to my pre-teen days of playing the original _THPS 2_ circa 2000. At the time, I used a joystick—pull the trigger to do a kickflip—plugged in to our family IBM desktop computer (remember CRT monitors?).

The point of this anecdote is that it can be quite fun and relatively inexpensive to tinker with old hardware. It’s one thing to throw top dollar at the latest and greatest computer components to be on the bleeding edge of performance, but, as we’ll see in this piece, older items—PCs and otherwise—can be just as much fun as more modern stuff, at a fraction of the cost. The higher cost of cutting-edge equipment isn’t necessarily only monetary, either.

(Despite my [latest warning](/journal/the-pendulum-swings) about “the tractor-beam pull of electronic distraction,” I will occasionaly play video games, preferably those of a finite length. After finishing _THPS 1 + 2_ this January, I haven’t really touched it since.)

I use and maintain a number of toys, including computers (usually a combination of an older desktop PC and a relatively more modern MacBook Pro), cameras and lenses, climbing gear, ski gear (a touring setup and, most recently, some nordic skate skis—another delightful nostalgia trip to my adolescent cross-country-racing days), bikes (usually a combination of a mountain bike and a cheap townie/commuter), and my car. If the marketing rhetoric from gear manufacturers in each of these industries is to be believed, gear is constantly improving, and us, as consumers, will get better performance—and thus more utility—by upgrading and acquiring.

Even if you have the means, however, staying on top of upgrades can be quite overwhelming. How often have we paid lots of money for a new smartphone, laptop, tablet, car, bike, etc. only to watch it rapidly become obsolete? And that assumes that said device actually lasts long enough to reach obsolesence. How heartbreaking is it when your new “investment” gets smashed shortly after you purchase it?

Tech is notorious for the pace at which gadgets become paperweights. Take MacBook Pros for example, one of which I am writing this essay on. In 2020, I purchased a refurbished 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro for nearly four-thousand dollars to replace my aging 2013 MacBook Pro (it would have cost even more had it not been refurbished). This purchase was a premeditated upgrade: after retraining in website development, I decided to upgrade my aging 2013 MacBook Pro and spec a newer one above the base model in order to maximize its usable lifespan. Sometimes, a few upfront upgrades can translate into a longer-lasting machine.

Sadly, this was not to be the case with my 2019 MacBook Pro. With the architecture change to M1, my Intel-based MacBook Pro will effectively become obsolete after just a few years. It is unlikely that I’ll hang on to it for a full seven years like both of my previous MacBook Pros (2006 and 2013). Yes, the switch to M1 is perhaps the most exciting news in Mac history since the switch to Intel from PowerPC back around 2005, but software support for Intel-based Macs will likely be dropped altogether within less than seven years, eventually rendering my machine unsuitable for dev work.

Upon the announcement of the M1 chip, online pundits reached a fever pitch over its improvements: ridiculous efficiency, thermals, and performance, resulting in laptops with longer battery life and reduced fan noise. If you follow hardware, you likely already know most of the M1’s advantages, but if not, just understand that it’s that kind of advancement that happens once in twenty years. While I’ll fully admit to finding this quite exciting, it does make me feel like a bit of a sucker for spending as much money as I did on my Intel-based MacBook Pro.

Had I waited another year or two, until the M1 or M1 Pro/Max were released, the timing of my upgrade could have worked much more favorably. A M1-based MacBook Pro would have a much higher likelihood of lasting seven years—but even then, today’s highest-end M1 Max will eventually become a vintage joke.

Technology is always advancing—that’s a given—but what is the best approach to staying current? We convince ourselves that we “need” a new computer, yet the thrill of new hardware is as fleeting as the sunset—great one moment, gone the next.

If you are upgrading from an existing computer, chances are you can measure the relative performance increase of the newer hardware. Reviewers and online pundits were quick to put the M1 MacBook Pros through their paces, in a flurry of benchmarks and tests, all extolling its breathtaking improvements.

But what are these improvements, really?

Say, for example, that you could now export your videos or photos in half as much time as before (not an actual benchmark). For most users, this likely equates to a few minutes per day of time saved. All that money for what is, principally, a slightly faster experience than before. A few minutes, a few times a week, of time saved waiting for your computer to crunch some numbers. Or longer battery life. Or quieter fan noise. Or any other subjective or objective performance measure that is qualifiably or quantifiably stronger than before.

You see, the price-to-performance curve is far from linear. At a certain point, modest gains in performance require proportionately exorbitant gains in price. Nowhere else along the price-to-performance curve is this more true than at the cutting edge, which, naturally, receives the most attention in promotion and discussion.

While expensive, high-performing toys can indeed be fun, owning them is not without pitfalls. With expensive toys can come additional worry. Worry about items breaking or getting stolen. Worry about expensive maintenance bills. Worry about getting adequate insurance coverage. While acquiring many of my toys, I bought many accessories and tools, thus requiring additional storage and mental effort to organize. As Tyler Durden said in _Fight Club_, “the things you own end up owning you.”

Perhaps actual freedom comes not in always getting what you desire—such as the latest and shiniest toys—but in being happier with less.

Per this piece’s intro—and in contrast to my experience with Macs—my PC hardware-upgrade approach has been far easier on the wallet. In the second half of this piece, let’s look at how this notion of being behind the price-to-performance curve, rather than at its bleeding edge, applies to some of my other toys. The idea here is to find creative new ways to use older items, resulting in the thrill of something different but without the sticker shock of the brand-new.

Continuing with computers, old hardware need not be junked as it ages beyond five or more years. Minor upgrades such as the aforementioned WiFi/Bluetooth adapter can extend the functionality or performance of old hardware in interesting new ways. I recently happened upon some old 1 TB 3.5-inch desktop hard drives. I replaced my ailing RAID 1 array (two 1 TB drives mirrored for redundancy, where one of the drives had been giving SMART errors for years and could fail at any minute) with a four-drive RAID 5 array (3 TB of usable space, with one drive for redundancy). For the non-geeks, just understand that my storage capacity tripled for zero dollars.

The recently released Windows 11 will not run on my ancient PC. This leaves me two options: keep running Windows 10, or switch to a Linux distribution. Almost all Linux distros have very modest hardware requirements. If you’re looking for a new purpose for an ancient Windows laptop or desktop, try installing Linux on it and seeing how the operating system flies.

In a slightly less geeky example of tech, I bought an older used iPad about a year ago (iPad Air 2, launched in 2014). It is now too slow to run any intensive apps or games, but it isn’t too slow for reading ebooks. No Apple Pencil, no Smart Keyboards—no problem, only a dedicated device for reading. (It also doubles as a website-testing device as there is no equivalent for actually seeing a website you are developing on physical, not simulated, hardware.)

Among other industries, photography is one where Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) can rear its head. It’s the same scenario as computers: enticing, expensive gear that quickly becomes replaced by newer and better offerings. I haven’t purchased camera gear in years but have been getting arguably some of my best photos recently.

With my older Sony NEX-6 body, I converted it to shoot infrared. This required disassembling the camera and removing the band-pass filter mounted over the sensor (a full-spectrum conversion). Then, for the price of a lens-mounted IR-pass filter ($50), I could shoot the invisible spectrum. (See [Forgetmenot and Sandy Ann
](/events/Forgetmenot-and-Sandy-Ann_June-2020) for some examples of IR photographs.) A terrific project, including an imaginative new way of thinking about photography (some IR shots work best at high noon on sunny days, which can otherwise be harsh in the visible spectrum), all with a very modest gear investment.

Bikes have also become prohibitively expensive of late. While I did upgrade to a late-model Norco Optic C2 last spring, my previous mountain bike, a Santa Cruz Tallboy LT, lasted nine years. Having maintained it quite well, I was able to sell it to offset the cost of upgrading to the Norco. The Tallboy did not come with a dropper post, so I ordered an [externally routed, cable-actuated post](https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/brand-x-ascend-ii-dropper-seatpost/rp-prod159176) in 2019 for around $150. While not as performant (less travel) than a fancier, more expensive hydraulic dropper post (often over $300), it does not require expensive servicing ($75 to $125 per service). Most of the performance, at a fraction of the cost.

While winter commuting in Calgary, I rode an ancient, rigid Specialized Rockhopper. In many ways, it was the perfect winter bike: already old and rusted, cheap to find parts for, and easy to wrench on. Salt and grit would usually destroy a drivetrain after a single winter, but 7-speed chains, cassettes, and middle chainrings (remember front derailleurs?) could all be found for under $50 total. Looking at my fitness numbers, I have never been as fit as when bike commuting over 10 km twice daily, including the infamous Hospital Hill (by Foothills Medical Centre). That old bike—laughably far down the bike price-to-performance curve—delivered tremendous utility at negligible cost. The equation improves further still when you factor in the opportunity cost of car commuting instead.

This notion of being behind the price-to-performance curve gets a bit more complicated with automobiles. While I wish it could be as simple as owning a cheap, old car, such vehicles can become prohibitively expensive to maintain if you are not mechanically inclined. My last three cars were all used and had 80–90 000 km when I bought them, and each lasted quite a few years.

Despite living a less-than-five-minute commute to a world-class ski hill, I opted not to pay for a season’s pass this winter. Part of this decision was my notorious cheapness—but another part was my desire for simplicity. Regularly skiing at the ski hill means more wear and tear on your skis. I have run a quiver-of-one setup for downhill/touring skis for years now, and to get serious about riding the resort would mean ideally getting another pair of skis with alpine bindings dedicated for resort use rather than abusing my lightweight touring skis. But more skis equals more bases to wax and edges to sharpen and space required for storage. Apply this same logic to nordic skiing, biking (see the “n + 1” rule), climbing, etc., and suddenly your garage is a gear shop.

With outdoor hobbies and passions, upgrading and expanding one’s gear collection can, unchecked, lead to some unexpected drawbacks like clutter and anxiety. There is something liberating about not having too many high-performing, expensive, depreciating assets like so many of the toys I have mentioned. The point I am arguing here is that at certain sweet spots, lower down on the price-to-performance curve, cheaper or older items can still offer tremendous utility, and, with a bit of creativity, some of them can even revitalized or modified to perform in new or unanticipated ways.
