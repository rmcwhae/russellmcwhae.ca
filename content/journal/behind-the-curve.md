My desktop PC turns 10 this year. It features a quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K processor, released in the second quarter of 2012. As far as gaming PCs go, this is effectively antediluvian. In [April 2020](/journal/adventures-in-low-end-pc-gaming), I put in some modest upgrades—a bigger, faster hard drive and a more powerful video card—for exactly $100 out of pocket.

This past Christmas, I added a WiFi card for around $40. This WiFi card also enabled Bluetooth, a first for my old machine. To test out this new connectivity, I bought a wireless Xbox controller—red, because that was the only colour on sale ($60). While I’ve never been much of a console gamer, certain games do play better with a controller (as opposed to a keyboard and mouse), such as the _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater_ (THPS) series. With my new controller, I played the recently released remake _THPS 1 + 2_ in a delightful nostalgia trip to my pre-teen days of playing the original _THPS 2_ circa 2000 with a joystick on our family IBM desktop (remember CRT monitors?).

(Despite my [latest warning](/journal/the-pendulum-swings) about “the tractor-beam pull of electronic distraction,” I will occasionaly play video games, preferably those of a finite length. After finishing _THPS 1 + 2_ this January, I haven’t really touched it since.)

The point of this anecdote is that it can be quite fun and relatively inexpensive to tinker with old hardware. It’s one thing to throw top dollar at the latest and greatest computer components to be on the bleeding edge of performance, but, as we’ll see in this piece, older items—PCs and otherwise—can be just as much fun as more modern stuff, at a fraction of the cost. The higher cost of cutting-edge equipment isn’t necessarily only monetary, either.

I use and maintain a number of toys, including computers (usually a combination of an older desktop PC and a relatively more modern MacBook Pro), cameras and lenses, climbing gear, ski gear (a touring setup and, most recently, some nordic skate skis—another delightful nostalgia trip to my adolescent cross-country-racing days), bikes (usually a combination of a mountain bike and a cheap townie/commuter), and my car. If the marketing rhetoric from gear manufacturers in each of these industries is to be believed, gear is constantly improving, and us, as consumers, will get better performance—and thus more utility—by upgrading and acquiring.

Even if you have the means, however, staying on top of upgrades can be quite overwhelming. How often have we paid lots of money for a new smartphone, laptop, tablet, car, bike, etc. only to watch it rapidly become obsolete? And that assumes that said device actually lasts long enough to reach obsolesence. How heartbreaking is it when your new “investment” gets smashed shortly after you purchase it?

Tech is notorious for the pace at which gadgets become obsolete. Take MacBook Pros for example, one of which I am writing this essay on. In 2020, I purchased a refurbished 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro for nearly four-thousand dollars to replace my aging 2013 MacBook Pro (it would have cost even more had it not been refurbished). This purchase was a premeditated upgrade: after retraining in website development, I decided to upgrade my aging 2013 MacBook Pro and spec a newer one above the base model in order to maximize its usable lifespan. Sometimes, a few upfront upgrades can translate into a longer-lasting machine.

Sadly, this was not to be the case with my 2019 MacBook Pro. With the architecture change to M1, my Intel-based MacBook Pro will effectively become obsolete after just a few years. It is unlikely that I’ll hang on to it for a full seven years like both of my previous MacBook Pros (2006 and 2013). Yes, the switch to M1 is perhaps the most exciting news in Mac history since the switch to Intel from PowerPC back around 2005, but software support for Intel-based Macs will likely be dropped altogether within much less than seven years, eventually rendering my machine unsuitable for dev work.

Upon the announcement of the M1 chip, online reviewers reached a fever pitch over its improvements: ridiculous efficiency and performance, resulting in laptops with longer battery life and reduced fan noise. If you follow hardware, you likely already know most of the M1’s advantages, but if not, just understand that it’s perhaps a one-in-fifteen-year jump ahead. While I’ll fully admit to finding all this quite exciting, it does make me feel like a bit of a sucker for spending as much money as I did on my Intel-based MacBook Pro.

Had I waited another year or two, until the M1 or M1 Pro/Max were released, the timing of my upgrade could have worked much more favorably. A M1-based MacBook Pro would have a much higher likelihood of lasting seven years. But even then, there will come a time when today’s M1 Max is but a vintage joke.

Technology is always advancing—that’s a given—but what is the best approach to staying current? We convince ourselves that we “need” a new computer, and yet the thrill of new hardware is as fleeting as the sunset.

If you are upgrading from an existing computer, chances are you can measure the relative performance increase of the newer hardware. Reviewers and online pundits were quick to put the M1 MacBook Pros through their paces, in a flurry of benchmarks and tests, all extolling its breathtaking improvements.

But what are these improvements, really? Say, for example, that you could now export your videos or photos in half as much time as before (not an actual benchmark). For most users, this likely equates to a few minutes per day of time saved. All that money for what is, principally, a slightly faster experience than before. A few minutes less a few times a week of waiting for your computer to crunch some numbers. Is upgrading the to newest tech really as great as marketing departments would have us believe?

With expensive toys comes additional worry. Worry about items breaking or getting stolen. Worry about expensive maintenance bills for the toys. Worry about getting adequate insurance coverage for said toys. While acquiring many of my toys, I bought many accessories and tools, thus requiring additional storage and mental effort to organize. As Tyler Durden said in _Fight Club_, “the things you own end up owning you.” While toys can indeed be fun, the possibility nonetheless exists for the things we love to go so far as to enslave us.

Having nice things ANXIETY…?

There is something to be said for keeping things simple.

Per this piece’s intro—and in contrast to my experience with Macs—my PC hardware-upgrade approach has been far more easier on the wallet. Let’s look at how this notion of being behind the upgrade curve, rather than at its bleeding edge, applies to some of the other toys I have mentioned. In essence, you can find creative new ways to take advantage of older hardware, resulting in the thrill of something different but without the sticker shock of new tech.

Continuing with computers, old hardware need not be junked as it ages beyond five or more years. Minor upgrades such as the aforementioned WiFi/Bluetooth adapter can extend the functionality or performance of old hardware in interesting new ways. I recently happened upon some old 1 TB 3.5-inch desktop hard drives. I replaced my ailing RAID 1 array (two 1 TB drives mirrored for redundancy, where one of the drives had been giving SMART errors for years and could fail at any minute) with a four-drive RAID 5 array (3 TB of usable space, with one drive for redundancy). For the non-geeks, just understand that my storage capacity tripled for zero dollars.

The recently released Windows 11 will not run on my ancient PC. This leaves me two options: keep running Windows 10, or switch to a Linux distribution. Almost all Linux distros have very modest hardware requirements. If you’re looking for a new purpose for an ancient Windows laptop or desktop, try installing Linux on it and see how the operating system flies.

In a slightly less geeky example of tech, I bought an older used iPad about a year ago (iPad Air 2, launched in 2014). It is now too slow to run any intensive apps or games, but it isn’t too slow for reading ebooks. (It also doubles as a website-testing device as there is no equivalent for actually seeing a website you are developing on physical, not simulated, hardware.)

Among other industries, photography is one where Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) rears its head.

Despite living a less-than-five-minute commute to a world-class ski hill, I opted not to pay for a season’s pass this winter. Part of this decision was my notorious cheapness—but another part was my desire for simplicity. Regularly skiing at the ski hill means more wear and tear on your skis. I have run a quiver-of-one setup for downhill/touring skis for years now, and to get serious about riding the resort would mean ideally getting another pair of skis with alpine bindings dedicated for the resort rather than abusing my touring skis. But more skis equals more bases to wax and edges to sharpen and space to store additional ski gear. Apply this same logic to nordic skiing, biking (see the “n + 1” rule), climbing, etc., and suddenly your garage is a gear shop.

## Ideas

-   Not more and owning the latest and greatest, but less.
-   Less house insurance, less worry/anxiety
-   Marie Kondo: get rid of items that don’t spark joy (listened to on my move to Revy, fitting)
-   Roadkill ripping on Lamborghini vs home built hot rod
-   A Canticle For Leibowitz materially great but lacked spiritual values
-   Find new ways to enjoy old technology: old PC, IR camera, Ubuntu, old iPad, old projector.
-   Things that we love can enslave us. Stuff cutting edge a few years ago. Thrill of new gadgets is fleeting. Get the same thrill without sticker shock or buyer’s remorse.
-   Unused mtn bike collecting dust, or the well loved old bike.
-   Old mtn bike dropper post $125
-   New $60 000 truck gets way better mileage than an older one. But does this really save money—or the environment?
-   Not too far behind: old cars (too old and expensive unless you are handy), sweet spot of age and mileage
-   Calvin and Hobbes: chewing magazine
-   Simplify: ski pass or bike-park pass: requires getting pass, burlier bike/skis, more maintenance, more complexity. The things we own end up owning us. (Fight Club: different context but same message)
