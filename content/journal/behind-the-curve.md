My desktop PC turns 10 this year. It features a quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K processor, released in the second quarter of 2012. As far as gaming PCs go, this is effectively antediluvian. In [April 2020](/journal/adventures-in-low-end-pc-gaming), I put in some modest upgrades—a bigger, faster hard drive and a more powerful video card—for exactly $100 out of pocket.

This past Christmas, I added a WiFi card for around $40. This WiFi card also enabled Bluetooth, a first for my old machine. To test out this new connectivity, I bought a wireless Xbox controller—in red, because that was the only colour on sale ($60). While I’ve never been much of a console gamer, certain games do play better with a controller as opposed to a keyboard and mouse, such as the _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater_ series. With my new controller, I played the recently released remake _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2_, beating all the levels in a delightful nostalgia trip to my pre-teen days of playing the original _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2_ (released in 2000) with a joystick on our family IBM desktop computer (remember CRT monitors?).

(Despite my [latest warning](/journal/the-pendulum-swings) about “the tractor-beam pull of electronic distraction,” I will occasionaly play video games, preferably those of a finite length. After beating _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2_ this January, I haven’t really touched it since.)

The point of this whole experiment is that it can be quite fun to tinker with old hardware. It’s one thing to throw top dollar at the latest and greatest computer components to be on the bleeding edge of performance, but, as we’ll see in this piece, older items—be they PCs, or otherwise—can be just as much fun as more modern stuff, at a fraction of the cost.

I use and maintain a fair number of toys: computers (usually a combination of an older desktop PC and a relatively more modern MacBook Pro), cameras and lenses, climbing gear, ski gear (a touring setup and, most recently, some skate skis), and a bikes (usually a combination of a mountain bike and a cheap townie/commuter). If the marketing rhetoric from gear manufacturer’s in each of these industries is to be believed, gear is constantly improving

## Ideas

-   Not more and owning the latest and greatest, but less.
-   Find new ways to enjoy old technology: old PC, IR camera, Ubuntu, old iPad, old projector.
-   Things that we love can enslave us. Stuff cutting edge a few years ago. Thrill of new gadgets is fleeting. Get the same thrill without sticker shock or buyer’s remorse.
-   Unused mtn bike collecting dust, or the well loved old bike.
-   You can export videos in half the time as before—really worth the high price tag
-   Not too far behind: old cars (too old and expensive unless you are handy), sweet spot of age and mileage
-   Calvin and Hobbes: chewing magazine
