**12:00 PM, February 23, 2019**  
In six years and over 150 days of backcountry skiing, I triggered my first avalanche.

Two friends and I were ascending the broad, south-facing summit ridge of Cirque Peak. Our intention was to ski Cirque North Couloir, a classic Rockies ski-descent that is frequently attempted in ski-guide exams.

Above tree line, the main ascent route gradually starts up the summit ridge. Low on this ridge, we encountered a restriction in our route: the ridge got narrower and steeper with a short gully ascending between two rock bands on either side. Too steep to skin, it would require a boot-pack. The alternative route of traversing out onto the looker’s-right face—a large, exposed alpine slope—was far less appealing.

I stowed my skis on my pack and began post-holing into waist-deep snow, punching through the wind-hammered crust endemic to so much of Rockies alpine terrain.

My hazard assessment had been that if the snow in the gully slid, it would likely have a small volume, and I’d go for a short ride down the centre of the broad ridge—hardly a terrain trap. The ridge had a low-enough angle (we’d been switchbacking up it on skins until that point) that I was not concerned about rocketing down it if the snow failed. (Or worse—tomahawking.)

Nearing the middle of my boot-pack, the wind pocket inside the gully released. All around me, the formerly stiff snow instantly shattered into large chunks in what felt like a single plink, as if a taught rope had suddenly been released.

Flipped over backwards, I was now sliding on my back, backpack and skis below me, head-first down the gully, like an inverted beetle. I distinctly remember trying to sense my velocity and if it was multiplying. Fortunately, I came to a stop, unburied, where the slope-angle relaxed a few meters down.

Unharmed, I righted myself and regrouped with my partners. My boots had filled with snow between the plastic shell and inner liners, which I cleared while waiting for my heart rate to settle. At my high point in the gulley, the avalanche crown was perhaps two feet deep at worst, tapering as it extended horizontally a few meters in each direction. Wind effect in the gully had created at least one buried weak layer in the snowpack, which the outer wind slab had slid on once my boot-packing had compromised its structural integrity.

![Looking down the summit ridge post-release. Note the chunks of snow to the left of the skier.](cirque_south_ridge.jpeg)_Looking down the summit ridge post-release. Note the chunks of snow to the left of the skier._

With the majority of snow flushed out of the no-longer-suspect gully, we opted to continue attempting our objective, which we completed without further incident. There is a bolted rappel near the summit which we used to rappel on two 40 m half-ropes. The rappel isn’t strictly necessary as the North Couloir is relatively low-angle, though it makes descending the upper rocky section more palatable.

My hazard assessment had been fairly accurate. Had I much more momentum when the wind-pocket broke, I could have continued sliding beyond the low-angle concavity of the ridge and over the next roll. The low volume of snow—no more than a [size one](https://www.avalanche.ca/tutorial/avalanche-formation/avalanche-size-and-impact) (relatively harmless to people)—had certainly been considered in our decision to boot up the gully (and not turn around). Wind slabs were the number-one problem in the [daily bulletin](https://avalanche.pc.gc.ca/bulletin-eng.aspx?r=1&d=2019-02-23) and were thus on our radar.

With the anticipated, benign avalanche, and a successful completion of our objective, as well as my long history of safe days in the backcountry, it is indeed tempting to think that I am quite proficient as risk management. There is a serious trap with this way of thinking, however.

It has been said the newly minted ski guides are perhaps the most dangerous skiers in the backcountry. This is a result of excessive confidence at having successfully passed their guides exams. This heuristic trap, the “expert halo”, is one of six such traps identified in Ian McCammon’s [landmark research](http://www.sunrockice.com/docs/Heuristic%20traps%20IM%202004.pdf) in the early 2000’s. (These six heuristic traps are now explained in AST 1 and 2 curriculae. If you are a backcountry skier and have not yet heard of such heuristic traps, it is now your homework read the paper before your next ski tour. Seriously, freaking do it.)

This winter a friend of mine was seriously injured in an avalanche. Out of respect for their privacy, I won’t go into detail about the incident, other than to say that it could have been a lot worse (a decent recovery is expected). Earlier in the winter, a young [Canmore doctor](https://calgaryherald.remembering.ca/obituary/laura-kosakoski-1078281016) passed from injuries sustained in an avalanche—an incredibly unlucky, unlikely misfortune. Her party was quite experienced; indeed, she and her husband co-wrote the forward to _[Kicking Horse Pass: Day Tripping](http://confessionsofaskibum.com/2019/09/09/kicking-horse-pass-day-tripping/)_, another local guidebook.

Despite increasing awareness of avalanche risk, there is an average of [12 avalanche fatalities](https://globalnews.ca/news/5052615/avalanche-types-sizes-safety/) across the country each year. As backcountry skiing has experienced a meteoric rise in popularity (think the scarcity heuristic trap), it sounds favorable that the fatality number has remained relatively constant, rather than increasing proportionately with the number of users. While a full analysis of such statistics is beyond the scope of this article, I instead want to take some time to examine the social fallout of avalanche incidents.

It seems that whenever there is an avalanche, a common enough response is to condemn the victim. Look at how negative online comments can get following human-triggered avalanches. (Yes, many responses are positive, so perhaps this essay is meant to address those few bad apples STUFF) This castigation can take one of two forms: ignorance and hostility, on the part of the non-backcountry-skiing general public; or suspicion, on the part of experienced backcountry skiers, at the decision-making that lead to the consequences observed. I will fully admit to being guilty of the latter, proudly calling myself a conservative skier with a safe, thoughtful approach to risk management and, again, a pretty clean track record to prove it.

While these may be instinctive responses, they are both quite shortsighted, as we’ll see.

## “Because it’s there”

George Leigh Mallory’s famously laconic response to the question “Why did you want to climb Mount Everest?” epitomizes the long-standing schism between climbers and non-climbers (or, in the context of this article, backcountry skiers and non-backcountry skiers). Both groups struggle to comprehend the other’s motivations in wanting to do what they do: non-climbers at why climbers would deliberately expose themselves to risk and suffering, and climbers at why non-climbers would prefer comfort and security over adventure, challenge, and personal growth.

John Porter illuminates the press’s attitude STUFF in _One Day as a Tiger: Alex MacIntyre and the Birth of Light and Fast Alpinism_:

> …the tabloid press attacks any activity they cannot fathom by trying to appeal to ‘conventional wisdom’; something the press usually creates for its own purposes. This is usually along the lines that nothing can be gained by putting people at risk, and the personal choice to do so is socially abhorrent, and in turn puts others at risk.

BIOL 107 example: science article journalism. Journalists would better understand science of they took a year of undergraduate science. The point is that you can’t judge someone without having walked in their shoes.

In _[Survivor’s Guilt In The Mountains](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/02/survivors-guilt-in-the-mountains)_, Nick Paumgarten interviews Conrad Anker and identifies a contrast between mortality in alpinism versus other institutions:

> Anker said, “A fundamental difference, and why people are critical of this, is that we do this by our own volition, whereas if you’re a firefighter, a soldier, or a police person, you’re a hero, you did that on behalf of other people in society, or because you had to.”
>
> Mountain climbing is a modern curiosity, a bourgeois indulgence. It consists mostly of relatively well-to-do white people manufacturing danger for themselves. Having been spared war, starvation, mass violence, and oppression, its practitioners travel great distances and endure great sacrifices to test their bodies and minds, encounter beauty, and experience the precariousness of existence and the terror and whatever revelations, fleeting or otherwise, may come of it. Though the whole enterprise may seem crazy or stupid or pointless, to many people it represents a necessary extreme of human endeavor, that combination of excellence and aberrance which propels a sliver of the population to set about going to the moon or writing symphonies, or dropping out entirely, as latter-day hermits and monks.

(Broke climbing bums may not quite agree with their lifestyles being classified as “bourgeois indulgences” given their poverty.)

Alpinist Nick Bullock, known for his style of hard, exploratory high-altitude climbing.

Bullock + House quotations challenging yourself.

Steve House:

> My boyhood friends turn detractors. They try to take me down with logic borrowed from their church of success. “What are you going to do when you’re old and your knees are shot. Are you saving for retirement?” I laugh at them, the laugh of the cornered villain who knows his escape. I will succeed because I must. Their slings and arrows are excuses for their failure to be brave enough, their failure to believe in themselves, their failure to commit to an unmapped future.
>
> Their born-again indoctrination makes them blind to the benefits of process. I trade stock in the future for cash in hand. I equal their fervor in my admonitions that their notions of success are meaningless. I charge that they are motivated by expectations that are not their own; busy with empty dramas that belong only to them.

Climbers are certainly aware of the risk in mountaineering:

House:

> I am weary of the disdainful superiority of alpinists like me who have survived, and who, chests puffed, cast knowing glances as if to say, “We are better than they were; we survived.”
>
> I’m tired of long black dresses and black jackets. My eyes are tired of crying. …
>
> There is a certain schizophrenia to these feelings. I feel a need to break from society’s structure, to move in a grand, natural environment, to measure myself, to find identity, and to prove my worth. These feelings teeter in balance with the fear of being the next one to be buried in an avalanche, to be hit by a falling stone, to fall to the bottom of a cliff, to get wedged in a crevasse, to become fatally exhausted. To die.

Bullock:

> Being a climber and in particular a mountaineer the thought of death is never far from my thoughts. This may sound melodramatic but it isn’t; the death rate in the Greater Ranges is high. I’ve never been of the ‘it will never happen to me’ school of thought. In fact, I’m not sure any mountaineers I know are. Most of my friends or fellow climbers appear very aware that life is a one-way road and because of this awareness they generally have that vibrancy and energy which is so evident.
>
> At times I sit and wonder what life actually is about and I always return to the same answer: it isn’t really about anything other than existence, and existing honestly and fully is the best for me. I will always be questioning, pushing, striving, and challenging. I know this is how Jamie Fisher [a Scottish climber who died on Mont Blanc at the age of 28] lived. What is sad is a life so full of energy being cut so very short. But to dwell too long on this is to wrap oneself in a blanket of fear.

## Wrong place, wrong time

A knee-jerk reaction among experienced backcountry skiers when news breaks of the latest avalanche involvement is to distance themselves from that party’s decisions. A report usually follows the incident with varying degrees of detail, and another skier—myself included—will inevitably scrutinize the circumstances and comment, _What were they thinking, skiing terrain like that in those conditions?_ I _certainly would not have done that._ Such a thought is unhelpful at best, however, and outright dangerous at worst.

Let’s first examine why avalanches are so hard to predict. Bruce Kay describes the ambiguity in assessing avalanche hazard in _Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose in the Avalanche Patch_:

> Avalanche risk is what is termed a “wicked problem.” Every problem encountered is uniquely variable, seldom fully understood and ever-evolving. Positive outcome is critical, yet solution is not conducive to a process of trial and error. Judgements are often made and committed to without adequate validation, and you better get it right because there is no trying again.

Kay describes a time during his work as a ski patroller at Blackcomb when even _unambiguous_ feedback proved misleading:

> The last thing to do before opening was to position myself at the top of Showcase Chute, a permanently closed, northeast-facing bowl leeward to the storm winds. A quick look showed a perfectly placed bomb hole that the helicopter crew had delivered an hour previous to an otherwise virgin slope of immaculate powder. It was by design that I found myself there, as Showcase is among the best lines on the mountain and a fitting prize for a job well done before a well deserved breakfast. I dropped in and stopped before committing. As was my habit, I did a quick review of the day’s work, looking for error or cues that I had missed something, that my assessment of good stability was false. Nothing. Skies were blue, snow was fine and I could practically taste the bacon and hash browns.
>
> Then, without thinking, I ski cut to the right. [Ski-cutting is stability test that deliberately tries to safely initiate an avalanche on a suspect slope.] Instantly, a fracture shot a hundred feet in front of my skis and my prize slid away with a hiss. It first went airborne over the first rock band, then loudly roared over the next, finishing dramatically with a big boiling powder cloud filling half the valley below.
>
> Sonuvagun! My control partners joined me on the slope with wide eyes, no longer thinking of breakfast. We muttered a few Hail Marys and then descended the bed surface to survey the damage. A good size 2.5 it was. What was remarkable was that the morning’s bombing hadn’t triggered it. But there you go: a rare but not impossible post-control avalanche. An outlier to the norm. The unforeseen. Bad luck or, as it turned out this time, good luck.

Avalanche hazard is thus impossible to accurately predict. Avalanche involvements could happen to any of us, despite awareness, experience, and adequate risk management.

The unfortunate truth is that if you play this game long enough, someone you know will get hurt or die. Avalanches impact experienced and inexperienced parties alike. To think that your decision making and risk management is necessarily superior to others who have experienced avalanche involvements is to make your own expert halo glow ever so brighter, a potentially fatal pitfall.

In my over 200 days in the backcountry, my relatively low avalanche involvement is perhaps as much attributable to luck as it is to my own judgment. Without doubt I have skied in terrain and conditions where others have triggered avalanches, somehow staying safe while others were not so fortunate.

In a [previous reflection](https://russellmcwhae.ca/journal/30-going-on-13#mcb_toc_head8), I argued “that _everyone_ who has gone through an outdoor apprenticeship long enough to become moderately competent can look back at sketchy situations in his or her own outdoor career where harm due to ineptitude was narrowly avoided.” Whether a party’s avalanche involvement is a result of their own lack of experience or simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is not correct to judge them.

There should be exactly zero space for negativity following an avalanche incident. In no ways did the victim earn or deserve their fate. You were not there, and you don’t know the context behind a party’s decisions. Armchair judgment is not helpful. When somebody is injured or killed, go and support them or their loved ones without judgment. If someone you loved got cancer, you would do your best to support them. If, say, they got lung cancer after smoking their entire life, it is still your responsibility to support them, despite thoughts of _I told you so_ creeping into your mind.

## So, what can we do about this?

We’ve seen how nobody should have the right to judge avalanche victims, including non-skiers and skiers alike. While it can be tempting to cast blame and point fingers, such conversations are almost never beneficial. Instead, let’s look at how we can learn from our collective mistakes and support an open, functional culture surrounding avalanche hazard.

I often think that the most statistically dangerous part of my mountain pursuits is highway driving. Unpredictable, fallible humans behind the controls of multi-ton metal structures in close proximity and at high velocity often enough results in catastrophe, yet we rarely think of motoring risks before stepping into our cars. If you never again in your life drove in a motor vehicle or ventured near cars, you _could_ effectively eliminate the chance of ever being involved in an automobile collision. This is no way to go through life, however (at least not for modern North Americans): radically minimizing risk involves severe practical limitations and is unfeasible for most of the population. Targeting the elimination of risk is therefore not a realistic goal—_managing_ risk is much more reasonable. Furthermore, there is risk with everything, including what we perceive as safe activities. Living a comfortable, sedentary lifestyle undoubtedly carries health risk.

Given the complexity of snowpack stability, an obvious solution to minimize avalanche risk might be to ski only easy, safe terrain. The Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES) is a terrain-classification system developed by Parks Canada in order to qualify terrain hazard. Three categories of terrain are identified: “Simple,” “Challenging,” and “Complex,” each with increasing hazard exposure. A Rockies guidebook (not the same one as where the first image was taken from), _Alpine Ski Tours in the Canadian Rockies_, by Chic Scott and Mark Klassen, includes only a single tour classified as “Simple,” however. Given the sparsity of such terrain, preferring low-risk terrain is simply not a realistic answer for most skiers. Instead, the most practical approach is to try to give yourself as much of a margin for error as possible, while accepting that exposing yourself to risk eventually becomes a numbers game: increased risk exposure means an increased likelihood of an avalanche involvement. At the same time, increased time spent in the mountains leads to enhanced judgment, which in turn decreases risk. The risk will never be zero, however.

Ed Viesturs risk Russian roulette?

This season I have skied with a few different partners who are about decade or more older than me, who have a decade or more of ski experience than me. Their approach to skiing contrasts to those with five years of experience or less. The older skiers know much more terrain options within most backcountry ski areas, having skied it multiple times across many different seasons and in many different conditions. Compare this to an aspiring young skier (with less than five years of experience) who is nonetheless fit, scrappy, and capable: the intermediate skier is far more concerned with proving themselves, of wanting to tick off big ski ascents and descents for their first time, while the older skier, having already done all of that, is far less likely to push objectives unless the conditions are appropriate. Young skiers are much more likely to push their objectives in the wrong conditions rather than to bail and come back another time. While the learning curve in backcountry skiing is never quite complete, I can say that bailing on objectives—for example, not forcing whiteout navigation on glaciers, if not absolutely necessary—has gotten easier over the years. The mountains will always be there, and a healthy long-term perspective is that you can always come back and re-attempt your objective in better conditions.

Another lamentable trend in backcountry skiing has been the perpetuation of what I’ll call “get-after-it dudebro” culture, wherein successful completion of an objective is immediately plastered all over social media, inevitably to glorify the poster. Perhaps I’m turning into a cranky old man; however, the less I engage with social media the less I miss it. Another component in this toxic culture is the idea of dissing other skiers for choosing less ambitious objectives—skiing “lame shit” is a term I’ve heard. Let me say here that it is completely inappropriate to condescend to someone for having a lower risk tolerance than you. Seriously, there are no excuses for this behavior.

Backcountry skiing has already experienced a major, positive culture shift. from STS/La Traviata. Ken Wylie: this is someone who thinks before he speaks.

To conclude this section, consider Bruce Kay’s question, “…when the avalanche hazard is Considerable, you really gotta ask yourself … why, exactly, are we not skiing the trees?”

## Conclusion

Despite increased avalanche-hazard awareness, despite enhanced avalanche forecasting tools, and despite improved rescue gear and tools, backcountry skiing will never have zero risk. It has to be a personal decisions whether or not you engage in backcountry skiing. Regardless of this decision, resist the urge to judge avalanche victims and perpetuate harmful culture within or outside the backcountry-skiing circle. Don’t criticize other skiers for having too low—or too high—of a risk tolerance. Avalanches can happen to anyone.

If you do decide to backcountry ski, take it upon yourself to be as educated as possible, seeking mentors to fill gaps in your knowledge and imbue in you a healthy long-term perspective for your relationship to the mountains. If you spend time in avalanche terrain, you owe it to yourself to read Bruce Kay’s _Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose in the Avalanche Patch_ this season. Full stop. Buy the [ebook](https://avalanchepatch.com/purchase-now/) and start reading it before your next ski tour.

> “SLAB! SLAB! SLAB!” Steve bellowed in and ascending scale of volume. I looked up to see the small carpet of windslab glide from its 10 centimeter by 10 m crown. It chequer-boarded into one foot by one foot squares that vibrated into white dust as they accelerated. The avalanche whispered by 5 m to my left. “If you must kick off slabs Steve-O, better that they are small ones.” I said.
