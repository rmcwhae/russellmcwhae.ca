As soon as I could walk I was on skis. Somewhere there is a video of me as a toddler shuffling around our childhood home on mini skis. Hockey was not in the cards; my brothers and I were destined to spend our childhood winters skiing.

Through our local nordic ski club, we learned to ski at a very young age: classic first, then skate a few years later. I still remember my first ski race at probably age eight or nine, a short lap around the Canmore Nordic Centre—I bawled my eyes out the entire time and finished last. Perhaps not the sign of a future prodigy. The nerves were too much for me to handle then. (And perhaps still are. I don’t quite understand the purpose of seeing who can make it around the hamster-wheel the quickest.)

Still, I stuck with nordic-ski racing for quite a number of years. In solo races, I rarely finished faster than the middle of the pack, though podium finishes were occasionally realized in relays when buoyed up by faster teammates.

In Grade 5, after my very first downhill ski day at Nakiska—where my brother and I were able to skip a few levels of lessons thanks to our nordic-skiing background—I concluded by asking, “What, exactly, is the exercise value in downhill skiing?”

Come junior-high school, my interests took to video games, and my middling nordic-ski-racing career took a backseat to electronic entertainment (at least as much as was permitted by my parents: maximum one hour of computer time per day). One fall with a particular lack of motivation on my part about the upcoming ski season, new skis to match my rapidly growing adolescent body were not purchased. I would still downhill ski on occasion to maintain some semblance of an active lifestyle, despite my earlier suspicion of its exercise benefit.

I haven’t owned nordic skis in over a decade, though I occasionally get out on borrowed gear and still have _dialed_ technique. (However, now that I live in one of the ski capitals of Canada, with nordic ski trails ten minutes from my house, I am currently in the market for a set of skate skis.)

Many of you can likely relate to this anecdote. How many of you had various childhood sports and passions that you pursued for a time, only to eventually give them up, often completely?

Almost all of my friends from high school were involved in sports such as cross-country and downhill skiing, speed skating, swimming, squash, hockey, soccer, badminton, running, and the like. We learned and practiced our sports, competed, and got as far as we possibly could—some much further than others—before hanging up our skates (metaphorically, or literally, as the case may be), rarely to lace up again with as much determination. We took the lessons of participating in sports as adolescents—learning how to establish and maintain an active lifestyle, training toward a goal, learning how to be part of a team, etc.—and applied these in other areas of our lives, leaving participation in our sport or activity to dwindle or end entirely.

That is to say, we pursued these activities to their logical conclusions.

Let’s back up for a minute. Over the course of these various adolescent athletic careers, each of us likely experienced various breakthrough moments: the _aha!_ moment of first nailing the weight-transfer of classic technique in nordic skiing, successfully making it down a double-black diamond ski run for the first time, scoring your very first goal, winning your first race. In our limited childhood horizon’s, such moments could only encourage dreaming: wouldn’t it be nice to become the best skier/swimmer/runner/skater in the club, province, country, or perhaps world? If our high-school guidance counselors are to be believed, shouldn’t we follow our passions and watch as everything else falls into place?

But then, suddenly, our childhood athletic careers are over. Our performance has apexed, our bodies no longer function as they used to, or our priorities and motivations have shifted. Instead of building anticipation toward future success, the watershed moments of our careers are now shrinking in our rearview mirrors—and are most certainly not closer than they appear.

Upon starting my first full-time engineering job in my early twenties, I rediscovered the notion of free time (don’t study engineering if you like idle evenings and weekends), and with it, took up mountain climbing. I signed up for a week-long Introduction to Mountaineering course out of Bow Hut, where we learned the basics of glacier travel, crevasse rescue, self-arresting with a ice axe, and compass-based navigation. A few of the other participants were Calgary locals, so we exchanged numbers and kicked off our mountaineering careers together.

We climbed together that summer, teaching ourselves the basics of sport and trad climbing, attempting a few different mountaineering objectives (including a doomed attempt of the Runde Traverse, more on that in [30 Going on 13](/journal/30-going-on-13)). When winter came, our aspirations changed to ice climbing and backcountry skiing—and a background in nordic skiing would turn out to be quite useful indeed in Rockies ski touring.

Having long since mastered downhill and nordic skiing, backcountry skiing was my logical next winter outdoor pursuit. Over the course of next number of seasons, I took courses, went on guided trips, and built up my gear, fitness, and experience. Unlike nordic skiing, the logical conclusion of my ski-touring career was nowhere in sight. Starting with day trips in benign terrain, I gradually worked my way up to ski-mountaineering, and multi-day tent-based traverses (where covering a lot of horizontal ground efficiently, as in nordic skiing, is paramount).

I have been both the well-to-do yuppie paying for guided, catered trips, as well as the dirtbag grad student, undertaking much more ambitious objectives with a much less ambitious budget. On a guided trip to [Mistaya Lodge](https://russellmcwhae.ca/photos/Mistaya-March-2014) years ago, we toured up to a col that overlooked the northern part of the Wapta Icefield. I took a photo of the vista, snow-covered alpine terrain, where the guide said you could see Peyto Hut. Not knowing where to look, it eluded me until a few years later when I stayed at Peyto hut on a self-guided traverse of the Wapta. Once I looked at my photo again, there Peyto hut was, once hidden, now no longer the rock outcropping I’d mistaken it for. (A few years after that, I skied the Wapta in a single day.)

In this grown-up version of my childhood nordic years, the dreams came just as readily too. *Now that I’ve got some decent experience, wouldn’t it be nice to pursue bigger and better objectives, maybe one day even make it to the Greater Ranges? After all, it’s regular people like me with enough drive and determination who make it as far as they do.*

Of all the literature I have read in the last five or so years, the single idea that has resonated with me far above everything else is a passage C.S. Lewis wrote on longings in _Mere Christianity_:

> Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise. The longings which arise in us when we first fall in love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy. I am not now speaking of what would be ordinarily called unsuccessful marriages, or holidays, or learned careers. I am speaking of the best possible ones. There was something we grasped at, in that first moment of longing, which just fades away in the reality. I think everyone knows what I mean. The wife may be a good wife, and the hotels and scenery may have been excellent, and chemistry may be a very interesting job: but something has evaded us.

What does this say about our dreams, though? Is the thesis of this piece—that every dream has a necessary conclusion—too hardened? Necessarily, all of our dreams—and indeed our lives—will end. The cynical corollary is thus to question whether such dreams are even worthwhile in the first place. Is achieving success, as in becoming a leader in your field, be it the outdoors or otherwise, often over multiple decades, only going to leave us at best partially satisfied—to say nothing of the cases falling short of the superlative?

Perhaps some insight can be found in our motivation for chasing dreams. Certainly, glory and respect hold their appeal.

## Conclusion

Even though many activities and passions come to an end, they are still worthwhile. It is great to pursue such passions. Obvious to the point of being trite?

## Ideas

-   Time warp/time stall: time vanishes in the mountains, despite having to be focused every minute, heli rescue fast but slow when cannot land. Years go by quickly, revisit same spots with more experience, different perspective.
-   High school guidance councillor: do what you love follow your passions etc, FIRE movement: this is wrong
-   Norman Collie slightly above average at multiple things
-   Jon Krakauer alpine mediocrity
-   Long-term perspective
    Ski guide skied enough powder for the rest of my life, start family, spent enough time camping on glaciers
-   Piper shells and golf swing
-   Paul Brand: surgeon, spirit passed on to others, not everyone confident/pretty, me more reserved in person. _Soul Survivor_ pages 84–85:

> I caught myself wondering how Paul Brand’s career might have played itself out had he stayed on London. Even working in a remote Indian village among outcast leprosy patients, he had achieved world renown. If he had stayed in a research capacity at a well-equipped laboratory, who knows what honors might have come his way. A Nobel Prize perhaps?
>
> But what then? His picture would join the others in the darkened hallway, now dusty and beginning to yellow. His name, like theirs, would appear as a footnote in the medical textbooks. Fame in the annals of medicine rarely lasts long; microsurgery techniques have already outdated most of the procedures considered breakthroughs in Brand’s youth. In contrast, his work as a missionary surgeon in India continues to bear fruit, in the transformed lives of Namo and Sadan [Leprosy patients treated by Dr. Paul Brand] and hundreds like them.
>
> …the true measure of our worth will not depend on a curriculum vitae or the inheritance we leave, but on the spirit we pass on to others.

-   Changing motivations: Unfinished projects due to injury, time, becoming a parent
-   Good steward: art school think visually not mathematically
-   Not getting opportunities to pursue passions: big in every field, cracked and torn
    _ What I have pursued: photography, etc
    _ No matter what you do, there is always someone better

## Fb intro

Essay time. Here is my latest piece, “Logical Conclusions”: (link). This is another topic that is near and dear to my heart and has been floating around my head for the last number of months until the pen (so to speak) finally got put to paper. Enjoy!
