In my final year of high-school English, we studied _Nineteen Eighty-Four_. One of the many quotations that stuck with me is about deprivation: “War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.” Such destitution, coupled with the chilling concept of thoughtcrime—“Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.”—illustrate Orwell’s predominant fear: that oppression would lead to our collective downfall. This notion likely reflected the devastation of World War II, after which the book was written.

No discussion on the cultural impact of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ would be complete without mention of Apple’s famous [1984 Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I), ending with the tagline: “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like “1984.” ” (this still gives me goosebumps). Postwar optimism and opulence fueled a departure from Orwell’s dystopian vision. Instead of being hoarded for the war effort, materials and resources could now be used for comfort, and North America entered into an unprecedented period of prosperity and technological advancement. Personal technology such as television, computers, and the internet, promised life-improving benefits with less manual work and more leisure then ever before.

A realignment of our collective psyche away from suffering and oppression toward relief and pleasure was certainly welcome—but what was to be the ultimate destination of this new direction?

In the forward to his 2006 book, _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_, Neil Postman argues that what we should caution ourselves against such a Huxleyan reality:

> What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in _Brave New World Revisited_, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In _1984_, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In _Brave New World_, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

It can be a pretty dark time of year as we progress into winter. On these cold, dark nights, it is too easy to turn on the TV and find endless distraction. After a day at work, the call of the couch can be a mighty tempting way of spending the evening. Cheap TV-subscription services abound, promising engaging storytelling and character development over many episodes and seasons, all so effortlessly available. This piece is a retrospection on my entertainment habits during winter: how I minimize TV viewing and maximize reading, my favorite form of distraction.

While a grad student, I subscribed to Apple Music. Included in this discounted membership ($5/month) was access to Apple TV+, which would otherwise have been a combined $15/month subscription (music and TV+). Ever one to take advantage of freebies, I watched a number of Apple TV+ shows through to completion: Ted Lasso, Servant, See, Mythic Quest, Defending Jacob, The Morning Show, and even Dickinson (still a bit surprised this one got a second season). For the most part, they were decent, entertaining shows. (Some are starting to [argue](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/apple-tv-plus-quality) that the limited selection but high quality of shows make Apple TV+ more of an HBO than a Netflix, which seems like a good strategy: quality over quantity, but this isn’t a TV-review piece).

Eventually, my student membership expired, and my monthly music subscription returned to $10/month, excluding Apple TV+. I figured I’d give Apple TV+ a break for a few months before re-subscribing—likely as part of an Apple One bundle—in order to wait for the release of subsequent seasons for many of the aforementioned shows. (My iCloud storage, which would be increased tenfold in an Apple One bundle, backs up my iPhone XR and Apple Watch. It has been hovering right around 4.3 out of the measly 5 GB of storage in the free tier for _years_ now. Whenever it fills up, I delete old photos. Just try and make me pay for more space. Also, see how this same parsimonious logic applies to my minimal [cell-phone bill](/journal/minimize-cell-phone).)

Only that as a month turned into two, then two into three, and so on until I lost count, I never renewed my Apple TV+ subscription.

Perhaps initially there was some kind of withdrawal—_This new release looks promising_—however, as time goes on, I don’t feel that I am missing out. This isn’t a complaint against Apple TV+ in particular (again, well-produced shows) but more so a caution against the addictively distracting nature of entertainment.

I am certainly guilty of vegetating. In previous years, I watched all seasons of _Breaking Bad_, _The Office (US)_, and most seasons of _House_, _The Big Bang Theory_, and _Homeland_, among others I have forgotten. Perhaps this is below average—I have never seen any episodes of most of the series listed on [Rolling Stone’s 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066095353/), let alone all seasons of more than a few shows.

While some of the shows I watched were well done, involving terrific storytelling, others were not. I remember clipping a comic from my local newspaper in high school in which a man dressed as a crook opens the top of a box TV-set being watched by a couple. As the litterer surreptitiously empties his garbage—fish bones and all—into the TV, the husband remarks to his wife, “Looks like Hollywood has just rolled out its fall programs.”

Recently, I purged some of my YouTube subscriptions, where the creators’ content no longer resonated with me. There can be a cynical, crass nature to a lot of pop culture these days, either directly, as in the case of certain very popular TV cartoons, or more insidiously. For an example of the latter, see the excellent video essay, [The Adorkable Misogyny of The Big Bang Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs). We in software call this “garbage in, garbage out.” If you routinely expose yourself to bunk TV shows, how long before it will rub off in your own ideas and vernacular?

If you must watch television, keep it as a treat. Rather than watching _everything_, trying to discover the next hit show, let someone else do that for you. After reading an article describing _The Sopranos_ as the best TV show of all time, I subscribed to Crave in Canada one fall for a single month ($20) to gain access to it. I made it through just under two seasons in that month, and quit when the subscription expired. The following year, I repeated the process, making it into season three or four. At this rate, it will take years to get through all six seasons—not a binge but a nice distraction done in moderation.

In the Sopranos episode “[D-Girl](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Girl_(The_Sopranos)>)”, Anthony Junior (A.J.), Tony’s son, starts questioning his faith after having read some Nietzsche. He mispronounces it—“nitch” instead of “nee-chee”—until A.J.’s godfather’s college-attending son Matt corrects him. Matt criticizes A.J.’s pseudo-existential attitude and recommends reading Kierkegaard. The son of a nominally Catholic mobster (see the sixth commandmant) rebelling against his parent’s faith—such superb writing! How many other TV shows have come any where near this level of depth?

I have a running theory that the quality of a given TV show is inversely proportional to the number of episodes before the cast starts sleeping with each other. If there isn’t enough going on that the writers need to resort to the usual Hollywood tropes within a few episodes, perhaps the show’s premise wasn’t all that strong the begin with.

Another show I would recommend is _Freaks and Geeks_, which unfortunately—or perhaps _fortunately_, given this piece’s thesis of watching less TV—lasted only a single season. It follows siblings Lindsay and Sam Weir as they navigate high school in suburban Detroit in the 80’s. Without getting into any more detail, understand that this was a show I would pay money to watch again. It’s also one of very few shows in recent memory to give a reasonable treatment of Christianity in pop culture.

Now that we’ve examined some of the pitfalls of over-indulging in television, let’s look at another way of distracting ourselves that can be more constructive. As most of you probably know, I am a huge reader. One of the most recent updates to my website is my [reading list](/reading-list), my now-public book-tracking list. As an aspiring writer, I try to read almost every day. While falling short of the “four to six hours a day, every day,” recommended by Stephen King in his memoir, _On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft_, I try to dedicate at least an hour to reading on free nights.

Next comes the question of what to read. I have found my attention span for reading to imitate a muscle: the more you use it, the stronger it gets, and vice versa with neglecting it. In my last long-winded reflection, [30 Going on 13](/journal/30-going-on-13#too-long-read-anyway), I recommended finding some trashy reading as a means to reinvigorate your desire to read. Eventually, you’ll be able to work your way up to much longer works.

In _Soul Survivor_ by Philip Yancey, Yancey interviews Dr. Robert Coles, a physician and instructor of literature in medical, business, and law schools. When asked about his devotion to literature, Coles explains:

> A man like Tolstoy knew more psychology than the whole twentieth-century social science scene will ever know. All this stuff about the stages of dying coming out now—why not just go back and read _The Death of Ivan Ilyich_? It said everything. And who has added any wisdom to the field of marital problems since _Anna Karenina_? And Dickens, oh my, what Dickens knew about human nature! (113)

Intrigued by this statement, I took it upon myself to read _Anna Karenin_ in its entirety. (Not all translators agree on naming customs: the terminal “a” of “Karenina” was dropped in my softcover version, translated by Rosemary Edmonds). It took many months to get through all 864 pages, though it never felt like a grind.

This is precisely the magic of literature: it can transport you into another time, place, or even world, and bring that world to life with a level of detail that is orders of magnitude greater than anything television ever has or could imagine (yes, this applies even to superlative shows like _The Sopranos_).

Your attention is your most valuable resource. There are only so many things in a given day you can distribute it across. Fight for it; guard it. When you need some downtime, try to turn off your screen and pick up a book. As high-school English teacher once remarked, “English is, after all, the stuff of life.”

## Ideas

-   _neeeeerd_
-   Anna Karenin over multiple months. People sometimes prefer TV shows for the character development that happens more so than in movies. Books take it to the next level yet.
-   Stephen King one book references another
-   Integrate titular pendulum
