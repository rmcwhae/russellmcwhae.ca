In my final year of high-school English, we studied _Nineteen Eighty-Four_. One of the many quotations that stuck with me is about deprivation: “War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.” Such destitution, coupled with the chilling notion of thoughtcrime—“Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.”—illustrate Orwell’s predominant fear: that oppression would lead to our collective downfall. This notion likely reflected the devastation of World War II, after which the book was written.

No discussion on the cultural impact of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ would be complete without mention of Apple’s famous Super Bowl ad, ending with the immortal tagline: “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like “1984.” ” Postwar optimism and opulence fueled the departure from Orwell’s dystopian vision. Instead of being hoarded for the war effort, materials could now be used for comfort. This alternate view, of having more material comfort, especially in the form of life-improving personal technology, may not have become the ultimate reality either, however.

In the forward to his 2006 book, _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_, Neil Postman argues that what we should caution ourselves against is more Huxleyan in nature:

> What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in _Brave New World Revisited_, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In _1984_, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In _Brave New World_, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

> This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

Let’s now examine what Postman feared, that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism.

## Passivity

While a grad student, I subscribed to Apple Music. Included in this discounted membership (half price, at $5/month) was access to Apple TV+, which would normally cost $5 more per month than the un-discounted Apple Music subscription ($15/month total). Ever one to take advantage of freebies, I watched a number of Apple TV+ shows through to completion: Ted Lasso, Servant, See, Mythic Quest, Defending Jacob, The Morning Show, and even Dickinson (still a bit surprised this one got a second season). For the most part, they were decent, entertaining shows. (Some are starting to [argue](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/apple-tv-plus-quality) that the limited selection but high quality of shows make Apple TV+ more of an HBO than a Netflix, but I digress.)

Eventually, my student membership expired, and my monthly music subscription returned to $10/month, excluding Apple TV+. I figured I’d give Apple TV+ a break for a few months before re-subscribing—likely as part of an Apple One bundle—in order to wait for the release of subsequent seasons for many of the aforementioned shows. (My iCloud storage, which would be increased tenfold in an Apple One bundle, backs up my iPhone XR and Apple Watch. It has been hovering right around 4.3 out of the measly 5 GB of storage in the free tier for _years_ now. Whenever it fills up, I delete old photos. Just try and make me pay for more space. Also, see how this same parsimonious logic applies to my minimal [cell-phone bill](journal/minimize-cell-phone).)

Only that as a month turned into two, then into three, and now enough that I lost count, I never renewed my Apple TV+ subscription.

Perhaps initially there was some kind of withdrawal—_This new release looks promising…_—however, as time goes on, I don’t feel that I am missing out. This isn’t a complaint against Apple TV+ in particular (again, well-produced shows) but more so a caution against the addictively distracting nature of entertainment.

quotation from Postman…

This caution is amplified in the case of less well-produced entertainment. Recently, I purged some of my YouTube subscriptions, where the creators’ content no longer resonated with me. There can be a cynical, crass nature to a lot of pop culture these days, either directly, as in the case of certain cartoons, or more insidiously. (For example, see the excellent video essay, [The Adorkable Misogyny of The Big Bang Theory
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs)). We in software call this “garbage in, garbage out.” If you routinely expose yourself to bunk—vulgar TV shows, social-media memes, BuzzFeed “listicles”, and the like—how long before it will rub off on you, in your own ideas and vernacular?

If you must watch television, keep it as a treat. Rather than watching _everything_, trying to discover the next hit show, let someone else do that for you. After reading an article describing _The Sopranos_ as the best TV show of all time, I subscribed to Crave in Canada one fall for a single month ($20) to gain access to it. I made it through just under two seasons in that month, and quit when the subscription expired. The following year, I repeated the process, making it into season three or four. At this rate, it will take years to get through all six seasons—hardly a binge. Another show I would recommend is _Freaks and Geeks_, which only got a single season. Watch something that comes recommended rather than sifting through Hollywood’s latest dumpster-dive offerings. Cutting down on the TV will also alleviate the sometimes annoyingly indecisive situation of trying to find a show your roommates/family/significant other can all agree upon.

(I have a running theory that the quality of a given TV show is inversely proportional to the number of episodes before the cast starts sleeping with each other. If there isn’t enough going on that the writers need to resort to the usual Hollywood tropes within a few episodes, perhaps the show’s premise wasn’t all that strong the begin with.)

## Egoism

How many of us millennials are guilty—now, or previously—of boasting about our lives on social media? I certainly am. By now we’ve had some time to examine the pitfalls of the digital world.

Your attention is your most valuable resource. There are only so many things in a given day you can distribute it across. Fight for it; guard it. Put down your phone, and pick up a book. Literature is here to stay, and will make your soul sing higher than any electronic entertainment ever will.

and, as another high-school English teacher remarked, “is the stuff of life.”
