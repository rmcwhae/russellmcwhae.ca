## Intro

These are the tools I use in my professional and creative workflows. Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) via the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast.

## Software

macOS all the way!

### Editor and Terminal

-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the fabulous [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) typeface.
-   Previously, I used [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/) for quite a few years.
-   [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

### Desktop Apps

-   [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) for vector work
-   [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for RESTful API design.
-   [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for database visualization. After trying many such apps over the years, this is by far my favourite.
-   [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ca/creativecloud.html) Photography plan, including Lightroom Classic for photo management
-   [Starry Landscape Stacker](https://sites.google.com/site/starrylandscapestacker/home) for photo astro-stacking

### macOS Utilities

A few useful apps that make macOS a bit more polished:

-   [BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay), changes brightness and volume of third-party external displays over DDC
-   [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app/), to test the camera before online meetings
-   [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), to customize my mechanical keyboard
-   [Rocket Typist](https://www.witt-software.com/rockettypist/), with useful expansions like "ll30" to "http://localhost:3000" and "ddate" for the current date
-   [Maccy](https://maccy.app/), for clipboard management
-   [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) for online backups

## Hardware

-   2023 14-inch MacBook Pro (10-core M2 Pro, 16 GB unified memory, 1 TB SSD)
-   Previously, a 2019 MacBook Pro 16-inch (8-core Intel Core i9-9880H, 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4 RAM, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4 GB, 1 TB SSD)
-   Before that, a Late 2013 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display (4-core Intel Core i7-4850HQ, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3L RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2GB, 512 GB SSD)
-   Before that, a 15-inch mid-2007 MacBook Pro (Intel Core 2 Duo T7500, 4 GB 667MHz DDR2 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 128 MB, aftermarket OCZ 120 GB SSD). The GPU in this laptop failed, requiring a logic-board replacement.
-   [27-inch LG 27UD68-W 4K Display](/journal/the-upgrade-to-4k)
-   [Ducky One 2 SF](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-SF) RGB White mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. Being relatively new to mechanical keyboards, they really are game-changers.
-   Magic Trackpad 2
-   Pulsar Xlite V2 wireless mouse
-   Desktop PC: NZXT H1 V2 case, Intel Core i3-12100F, 16 GB RAM, 1 TD SSD, MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (see [Project PC Upgrades](/journal/project-pc-upgrades)).

## Camera Gear

### Bodies

-   Sony a6000
-   Sony NEX-6, converted to shoot infrared per [this walkthrough](http://www.ir-photo.net/ir_nex6mod.html)

Though a bit dated now, these bodies work very well for stills and are quite light and compact.

### Lenses

-   Sony E 16 mm f/2.8 pancake: very pocketable but with soft corners
-   Sony/Zeiss E 24 mm f/1.8: wickedly sharp and good in low light
-   Sony FE 50 mm f/1.8: an excellent medium length
-   Sony FE 70–200 mm f/4 G: quite sharp and much lighter than an f/2.8

Lately, I’ve been trying to challenge myself creatively by primarily shooting with a single lens for six months to a year.

### Other

-   GorillaPod
-   Circular polarizing filter
