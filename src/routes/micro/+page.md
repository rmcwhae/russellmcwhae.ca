### New favorite workout

My daily workouts have long consisted of a mix of cardio and strength training. I‚Äôve always taken advantage of free gym memberships when they have been available, though I have not had such an option since leaving the city over four years ago.

Lately, I‚Äôve been inclined toward free/cheap workouts that can be done with minimal commuting or equipment. Why pay for a gym membership, when you can do an effective upper-body workout with a pull-up bar, a yoga mat, and a few dumbbells, all without leaving your house? A lot of my biking‚Äîmountain and road/gravel‚Äîcan be done without needing to drive anywhere (yes, I am spoiled to live where I do). Nordic skiing is only a fifteen drive away too (terrific cardio, but it requires maintaining equipment and commuting).

A [recent book](/reading-list), _Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity_, by Peter Attia, MD, introduced me to the workout of ‚Äúrucking‚Äù: walking with a heavy backpack. In a way, I‚Äôve been rucking already during summer backpacking trips or winter ski traverses, though I hardly touch my expedition backpack outside of such trips.

Given my slender dimensions, I get major hip chafing when hauling around a big backpack on multi-day trips. I pre-emptively tape my iliac crests before such undertakings, though the first few days are usually uncomfortable when backpack weights start exceeding 45 pounds.

Maybe the real solution here is more functional training. Throw some weights into my 75 liter backpack and _ruck_ around my neighborhood a few days a week.

Simple, time-effective, free, brilliant. üëå

### Starting a microblog

As my [Journal](/journal) usually has long gaps between posts, I have created this page to try my hand at some more frequent, shorter-form content. Given that I already have this website as a platform, I‚Äôd much rather use it for publishing such content than using an existing micro-blogging service (and being at the whims of someone else‚Äôs system). If anything, this is an encouragement to myself to journal more, something I can too easily fall behind on.
