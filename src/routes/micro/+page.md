### Starting a micro-blog

As my [Journal](/journal) usually has long gaps between posts, I have created this page to try my hand at some more frequent, shorter-form content. Given that I already have this website as a platform, I’d much rather use it for publishing such content than using an existing micro-blogging service (and being at the whims of someone else’s system). If anything, this is predominantly an encouragement to myself to journal more, something I can too easily fall behind on.
