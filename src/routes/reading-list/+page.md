title: Reading List

Reading is how I feed my soul. I saw a comment somewhere that a small bookstore contains more wisdom than all of television, which I wholeheartedly agree with. My reading generally includes a mix of classics, popular fiction, science fiction, non-fiction, Christian non-fiction, memoirs, satire, and mountaineering literature.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the books I have read, in reverse chronological order. Mostly, this is for me to keep track of things, but if I didn’t enjoy or complete a book, it won’t be here, so you could perhaps use this as a source of inspiration if you’re in need of something new to read. Books featured here are a combination of physical books and e-books, which I read on an iPad.
