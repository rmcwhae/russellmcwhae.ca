Sometimes my friends shoot our ski days with GoPros. Here are some videos that they took. I do make appearances in each of this videos.

- January 27, 2014: [Mount Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVn1yhuvz4g)
- February 11, 2017: [Grizzly Shoulder, Rogers Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kpBHzbgQJg). Probably the best pow I have ever skied. Grizzly Shoulder is among the lowest-hanging fruit of backcountry ski terrain at Rogers Pass and as such it attracts its share of traffic and is tracked out for most of the winter. In this video, Grizzly Shoulder had been closed for three days due to a storm, and we were the second party to ski it upon re-opening.
